# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This is a fork of the code samples for the book by Michael Nielsen ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).

Additions so far are:

- code works with Python 3
- added fast versions of network and network2
- added first version of network4 which is a re-write of network3 but in Tensorflow

What is missing:

- finish convolutional layer port to Tensorflow
- investigate why l2 regularization does not work properly in network4
